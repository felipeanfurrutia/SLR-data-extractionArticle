\section{Introduction}

%Describe the practice in which the problem addressed appears
There is a growing body of literature that recognises the importance of conducting secondary studies in Software Engineering (SE). Systematic Mapping Study (SM) and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) are the most common type of secondary studies conducted in SE. Main differences between SM and SLR are that the former aims to know what is done in a specific topic or area, or identify research gaps, whereas the latter aims to aggregate information from the outcomes of qualitative primary studies \cite{Kitchenham2015} and reports a synthesis \cite{Wohlin2013}.

A key aspect of conducting secondary studies in Software Engineering is that they are similar to quantitative and qualitative research \cite{Wohlin2013}.  
%Most of the secondary studies are performed by novice researcher (e.g. phD students) \cite{Carver2013}. 
conducting secondary studies in Software Engineering encompasses different activities: Protocol definition, Searching, Study Selection, Data extraction (DE) and Data Synthesis. As far as Data extraction (DE) is concerned, the extracted data feeds the next activity: classifying (in SM) and data synthesis (in SLR) \cite{Garousi2017}.

%Describe the practical problem addressed, its significance and its causes
Research has shown that a major problem within conducting secondary studies in Software Engineering is that Secondary studies do not report in a clear and effective manner \cite{Budgen2018}. Specifically, the data extraction (including quality assessment), synthesis, and the process followed by reviewers need better reporting. This problem is of particular concern as it is now well established that it can affects negatively to the trustworthiness of the findings of the secondary study \cite{Cruzes2011}.  

Credibility in thematic synthesis deals with extracting the most suitable units of data or segments of text, how well codes and themes cover data, or how to judge the similarities with and differences between themes.

This can lead to a SLR not be reliable \cite{Garousi2017} \cite{Wohlin2013}, the aggregations in codified form are hard to read and understand \cite{Dieste2008}, Little confidence about the findings, It is difficult to asses the scientific credibility of its results by SLR  readers and SLR results are difficult to compare. 

Causes can be diverse: (1) lack of internal/external validation \cite{Ampatzoglou2019}, (2) reviewers do not know which data is relevant \cite{Brereton2011}, (3) reviewers do not understand data extraction requirements \cite{Brereton2007} \cite{Zhou2017}, (4) innacurate or missing data: insufficient information for the extraction process \cite{Zhou2017}, (5) researcher is novice \cite{Ribeiro2018} \cite{Carver2013}, (6) relevant information is spread among different sections \cite{Budgen2018} \cite{Budgen2018}, (7) Extensive body of knowledge to be screened, classified and synthesized \cite{link.springer.com}, (8) effort to meet consensus (when many reviewers take part in data-extraction phase) \cite{Ribeiro2018} \cite{Riaz2010} \cite{Brereton2007} \cite{Staples2007} \cite{Bandara2015}, (9) too much time finding evidences, (10) too many studies to review \cite{Garousi2017}, (11) agenda problem and too many meetings \cite{Staples2007} \cite{Staples2007}, (12) geographically distributed-teams \cite{Riaz2010}, (13) researcher's bias \cite{Imtiaz2013} \cite{Ribeiro2018} \cite{Zhou2017} \cite{Zhou2017}, (14) data problems \cite{Bandara2015}, (15) data extraction forms are fulfilled manually or require too many mouse clicks \cite{Staples2007} \cite{Ramezani2017} \cite{Ramezani2017} \cite{Bandara2015} \cite{LU2008} and (16) Current specific software related to SLR and CAQDAS are not used. 
    
%Summarise existing research including knowledge gaps and give an account for similar and/or alternative solutions to the problem
Existing research has tackled these causes. Petersen et al. addressed the too much time finding evidences \cite{Petersen2015}. Garousi et al. addressed the too much time finding evidences \cite{Garousi2017}. However, this approach has the following limitation: they are fulfilled manually. Garousi et al. addressed the geographically distributed-teams \cite{Garousi2017}. LU et al. addressed the data extraction forms are fulfilled manually or require too many mouse clicks \cite{LU2008}. Lu et al. addressed the data extraction forms are fulfilled manually or require too many mouse clicks \cite{Lu2008}. However, this approach has the following limitation: data format requirements \cite{Lu2008}. 
    
%Formulate goals and present Kernel theories used as a basis for the artefact design
In this work, we address 5 main causes: peer review is effort intensive and also takes more calendar time, too much time finding evidences, geographically distributed-teams, data problems and data extraction forms are fulfilled manually or require too many mouse clicks. To lessen these causes, we resort to provides a basis for establishing credibility and validity, make the examination of qualitative data more complete and rigorous, it is a requirement from the community, higher effectiveness, faciltate information sharing and knowledge exchange and interfaces to transfer data among tools.
